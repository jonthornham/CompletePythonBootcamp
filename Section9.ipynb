    "# If you have a folder structure and place an __init__.py file inside the folder you mark the folder as a Python Package. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Here are a few important points about the `__init__.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Package Initialization:** When Python encounters an `__init__.py` file inside a directory, it treats the directory as a package. This \n",
    "# allows you to organize your code into multiple modules within a package, making it more manageable and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Symbol Export:** You can use the `__init__.py` file to specify which symbols (functions, classes, variables) from the package should be \n",
    "# accessible when the package is imported. You can do this by explicitly importing the symbols in the `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    For example, consider a package structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    mypackage/\n",
    "#    ├── __init__.py\n",
    "#    ├── module1.py\n",
    "#    └── module2.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#    In `__init__.py`, you can import specific symbols from `module1` and `module2` to make them accessible when the package is imported:\n",
    "\n",
    "# from .module1 import function1\n",
    "# from .module2 import MyClass\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Now, when someone imports `mypackage`, they can directly use `function1` and `MyClass` without having to import them from `module1` and `module2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Package-Level Initialization:** You can also use the `__init__.py` file to perform package-level initialization tasks. For example, setting \n",
    "# package-wide configurations or variables, or importing modules that should be available as soon as the package is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Example __init__.py contents for package-level initialization\n",
    "print(\"Initializing mypackage...\")\n",
    "config_variable = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you import a module from a package, Python looks for an `__init__.py` file in the package directory. If it finds one, it executes the code within \n",
    "# the `__init__.py` file before importing any other modules from the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note: In Python 3.3 and above, the `__init__.py` file is not strictly required for a directory to be recognized as a package. However, it's still commonly \n",
    "# used for the purposes mentioned above and for backward compatibility with older Python versions."

    "# __name__ and __main__\n",

    "# variable for that file. If the file is being run directly, __name__ is set to '__main__'. If the file is being imported as a module into another script, \n",
    "# __name__ is set to the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Inside func() in example.py\n",

    "# By using if __name__ == \"__main__\":, you can create reusable modules. The code inside this block will only run if the script is being run directly, \n",

    "\n",
    "# This pattern is particularly useful when you have utility functions or classes in a script that you might want to reuse in other projects. These \n",
    "# utilities can be defined in the script, and the main logic of the script can be placed under if __name__ == \"__main__\":, ensuring it only runs when the script \n",
