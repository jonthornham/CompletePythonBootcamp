    "# Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python involves creating and using classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, \n",
    "# and an object is an instance of a class. Classes define properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that are common to all objects \n",
    "# created from that class. Here's a basic explanation of how OOP works in Python along with an example of a class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Definition in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, you define a class using the `class` keyword. Here's the basic syntax of a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # Class attributes (optional)\n",
    "    class_attribute = \"I am a class attribute\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Constructor method (optional)\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):\n",
    "        self.parameter1 = parameter1\n",
    "        self.parameter2 = parameter2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Instance method\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `class ClassName:`: This line defines a new class named `ClassName`.\n",
    "# - `class_attribute`: This is a class attribute that is common to all objects created from this class.\n",
    "# - `__init__(self, parameter1, parameter2)`: This is the constructor method. It initializes the object's attributes when the object is created. \n",
    "#    `self` refers to the instance of the class (the object being created). Most languages don't required you to add self like this but Python does.\n",
    "# - `method_name(self)`: This is an instance method. It performs actions related to the object. `self` is a reference to the instance calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Class Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's define a simple `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `greet()`:\n",
    "# Note: Class attributes are the same for every instance of a class. Species is like saying let x = \"Value\". Just remember there is not let or const in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    # Class attribute. Outside of Constructor. \n",
    "    species = \"Homo sapiens\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Constructor method. Needed. \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Instance method. Must use self. Can add other parameters. \n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects (instances) of the class. You can add the parameter name if you like. Order matters.\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(name=\"Bob\", age=35)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and calling methods\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person2.age)   # Output: 35\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person1.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "print(person2.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 35 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, `Person` is a class that has attributes `name` and `age`, a class attribute `species`, and a method `greet()`. \n",
    "# Objects (`person1` and `person2`) are created from the `Person` class, and attributes are accessed and methods are called \n",
    "# using dot notation (`object.attribute` or `object.method()`). This is a basic illustration of object-oriented programming in Python."
