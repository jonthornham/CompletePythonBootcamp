    "# Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or classes without changing their source code. \n",
    "# They allow you to wrap another function or method to add functionality before or after the wrapped function's execution. Decorators are commonly used for \n",
    "# tasks such as logging, timing, access control, and memoization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax of a Decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, a decorator is a higher-order function that takes a function (or a class) as an argument and returns a new function (or a modified class). The \n",
    "# syntax to apply a decorator to a function looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "# @decorator\n",
    "# def function():\n",
    "#     pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here, `decorator` is a function that wraps the `function` and modifies its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Creating a Decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A decorator is just a regular Python function. Here's how you can create a simple decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decorator function\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()  # Call the original function\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying the decorator using @ syntax\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the decorated function\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
    "# Hello!\n",
    "# Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, `my_decorator` is a decorator that adds behavior before and after the `say_hello` function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Decorators with Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decorators can also accept arguments. This allows you to create more flexible decorators. Here's an example of a decorator with arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decorator function with arguments\n",
    "def repeat(n):\n",
    "    def decorator(func):\n",
    "        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "            for _ in range(n):\n",
    "                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "            return result\n",
    "        return wrapper\n",
    "    return decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying the decorator with arguments\n",
    "@repeat(3)\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the decorated function\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hello, Alice!\n",
    "# Hello, Alice!\n",
    "# Hello, Alice!\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, `repeat` is a decorator factory that takes an argument `n` and returns a decorator. The returned decorator repeats the decorated function \n",
    "# `n` times when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decorators provide a powerful way to modify the behavior of functions and classes in Python, making the language more flexible and expressive. They are widely \n",
    "# used in Python frameworks and libraries to enhance functionality and simplify code."
