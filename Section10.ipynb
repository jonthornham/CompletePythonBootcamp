    "# Errors and Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "#Certainly! Error and exception handling in Python is managed using the `try`, `except`, `finally`, and optionally, `else` blocks. These constructs allow you to \n",
    "# handle errors and exceptions gracefully, preventing your program from crashing when unexpected situations occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `try`, `except`, and `finally`:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **`try` block:** In the `try` block, you place the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "# - **`except` block:** In the `except` block, you handle specific exceptions that might occur in the `try` block. If any exception occurs in the `try` block, Python \n",
    "# looks for a matching `except` block to handle it.\n",
    "# - **`finally` block:** The `finally` block, if used, will always be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's typically used for cleanup actions, \n",
    "# like closing files or releasing resources, and is executed no matter what, even if there was no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Handle a specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed!\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handle other exceptions\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code in this block will always be executed\n",
    "    print(\"Finally block: This will always run, regardless of exceptions.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs in the `try` block. The first `except` block handles this specific exception. If a different type of exception occurred, \n",
    "# it would be handled by the more general `Exception` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `else` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **`else` block:** The `else` block, if used, is executed if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. It's typically used for code that should run only if the \n",
    "# `try` block doesn't raise any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's the updated syntax with the `else` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Handle a specific exception\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed!\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handle other exceptions\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code in this block runs only if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "    print(\"Division was successful! Result:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code in this block will always be executed\n",
    "    print(\"Finally block: This will always run, regardless of exceptions.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, because there is no division by zero, the `else` block will execute, and the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Division was successful! Result: 5.0\n",
    "# Finally block: This will always run, regardless of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, you can handle exceptions gracefully and ensure that your program behaves predictably even in the face of errors."
